I did lister to "allEmployees" div, for change the cards when the user over them with the mouse.
The cards are children of "allEmployees", and I want to recognize the specific card that the mouse over on it.
### differences between mouse enter vs mouse over:

* **mouse enter** - when the mouse enter to "allEmployees", not recognize the specific child.

* **mouse over**  - when the mouse over on specific card in allEmployee, so we can know which child the mouse over about.

### differences between mouse leave vs mouse out:
* **mouse leave** - when the mouse leave "allEmployees", not recognize the specific child.
* **mouse out**  - when the mouse out from specific card in allEmployee, so we can know which child the mouse out from.
